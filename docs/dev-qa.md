# WiredPart Q&A — Requirements & Design Questions

> **Purpose:** Before building any feature, questions are generated here for the owner to answer.
> Questions are organized by feature/change with role-based perspectives.
> **Auto-maintained by:** dev-pipeline-manager scheduled task

## How This Works

1. When a new plan is added or a GitHub issue is filed, questions appear here
2. Each question includes context about the current build and proposed changes
3. Questions are tagged by role perspective: Owner, Manager, Employee, Developer, User
4. Answer the questions by editing this file (write answers below each question)
5. Once answered, the dev-pipeline-manager integrates answers into the plan and **removes the question from this file**
6. Unanswered questions block the feature from being auto-built
7. **This file only contains unanswered/unprocessed questions.** Once processed, they're gone — design decisions live in `docs/plans/`.
